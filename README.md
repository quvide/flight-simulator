Calculates ans visualizes trajectories of high speed rounds. It considers
* air density as a function of altitude
* drag coefficient as a function of speed of air (which is a function of altitude)

It doesn't consider:
* curvature of the earth
* local weather conditions

## Dependencies
* libsdl
* libsdl_ttf

## Building and running
1. place any font as font.ttf in the same folder as main.cpp
2. run `g++ main.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf -o main`
3. ./main [angle in deg] [mass in kg] [area in mÂ²] [initial velocity in m/s]
